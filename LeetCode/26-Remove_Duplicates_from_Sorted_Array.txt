Leetcode 26 - Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
    
    Integer array (nums) sorted in non-decreasing order
    Remove duplicates in place so each unique element appears only once
    Relative order of elements must be maintained
    Return the number of unique elements in nums

    Need a slow pointer and a fast pointer
    Slow pointer is where the next value needs to go
    Fast pointer searches for the next value

    First solution:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        int slow = 0;
        int fast = 0;

        while (fast < nums.size())
        {
            if (nums[slow] != nums[fast])
            {
                nums[++slow] = nums[fast++];
            }
            else
            {
                fast++;
            }
        }

        return slow + 1;
    }

    This is the solution that is given in the editorial; nice
